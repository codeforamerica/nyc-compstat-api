# NYC Compstat API

New York City revolutionized the way cities were policed with their COMPSTAT
approach. The police department releases partial reports of the data that they
collect, but this information is hidden in PDF documents that disappear after a
week. This service aims to provide a historical archive of these weekly
compstat reports and a machine queryable interface to this data.
